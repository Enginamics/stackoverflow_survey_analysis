    "- **Question 1: ... did the difficulty of the survey increase over the past years?**\n",
    "  - *Relevance*: Understanding changes in survey difficulty over time can help to ensure that any observed trends or patterns in the results are not due to changes in survey complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 2: ... does the length of the survey have an effect on its experienced difficulty?**   \n",
    "  - *Relevance*: Evaluating if the length of the survey influences the perceived difficulty helps to understand if the responses are affected by survey fatigue, which could impact the reliability of the results and the quality of the data collected.\n",

    "- **Question 3: ... did the age of participants change over the past years?**   \n",
    "  - *Relevance*: Analyzing changes in the age distribution of participants over time can reveal demographic shifts in the survey population."
